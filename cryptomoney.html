                <h1>Will cryptocurrency be the dominating currency in the future?</h1>
                <p>With the steady rise of popularity for the use of cryptocurrency, it is bound to be a part of our daily lives soon enough as the advantages could really help citizens with managing their own money without the involvement of third parties such as banks and governments. Also, business owners are using cryptocurrencies to streamline their operations and cut expenses. </p>
                <p>Other than that, it is expected that new cryptocurrencies will emerge in the future as blockchain technology continues to improve. Soon enough, the difference between how safe and reliable cryptocurrency will be compared to old paper money will be so apparent that traditional currencies could be phased out of our lives entirely. </p>
                <p>Cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology as a way to keep track of transactions without the fear of being tampered with by an outside party. Blockchain technology can be used for many other purposes other than for cryptocurrency. For example, it could be used to keep track of medical records or even a way to keep track of inventory in a convenience store.</p>
                <p>With the use of this technology in other sectors, people will not be so skeptical about the use of cryptocurrency as the system of how it works and operates will be familiar to many already by the use of blockchain technology, making the transition feel seemless.</p>

                 <h1>How does crypto affect real world money?</h1>
                 <p>Many of you reading here, will wonder if crypto will affect real world money as the time goes? With the advancements in cryptocurrency, surely real world money will be affected. While that prospect is not happening as of now, cryptocurrencies will play a major role in how we complete our transactions and keep track of our money.</p>
                 <p>If this happens, banks will have less power when it comes to managing monetary policy through the control of the money supply. Less money will flow through to banks as people start adapting to blockchain technology and manage their own money to avoid any interest fees, transaction limits and so on. If this happens long enough and banks do not integrate with cryptocurrencies, it could mean the end for major banking companies such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and others.</p>

             <div id="why">
                <div class="filler"></div>
                 <h1>Why are billionaires asking people to invest in crypto?</h1>
                 <p>Cryptocurrencies are getting more and more attention around the world, and have become the focus of investors due to several factors. Cryptocurrencies are making more and more people millionaires or even billionaires. For example, the founder of Binance - Zhao Chang Peng, his wealth has grown to over 10 billion USD by his cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
                 <p><strong>There are reasons why billionaires encourage us to buy up cryptocurrencies.</strong></p><br>
                 <h4>1. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised</h4>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Not backed up and owned by the government.</li>
                     <li>Transactions with Bitcoin are quicker and less expensive, due to there being no middleman involved</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h4>2. Safe and Secure</h4>
                 <ul>
                     <li>No one can access your assets unless they gain access to your crypto walletâ€™s private key</li>
                     <li>Transactions are secured by the blockchain system along with the scattered network of computers that verify the transactions.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h4>3. Cryptocurrencies are a great investment after Covid hits</h4>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, its value will rise over time and is not affected by inflation.</li>
                     <li>Traditional currencies will tend to lose value over time because of inflation,economy and political issues of the country.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>We can see the economy of Malaysia has been on a downfall since the first lockdown hit. Investors of stocks will not be benefited by the economy. Therefore, cryptocurrencies stand up as an alternative investment for the whole pandemics.</p>

                 <h1>The difference between paper money and cryptocurrency</h1>
                 <p>Paper money, known as Cash or Fiat money and cryptocurrency, known as digital or virtual money. Both of them are very different from each other in terms of volatility to protection and supply to control.</p>
                 <ul>1. Value and Volatility
                     <li>cryptocurrencies is very volatile</li>
                 </ul>
