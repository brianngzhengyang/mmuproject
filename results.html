                <p>Cryptocurrency serves as <b>a medium for exchanging or for storing value</b> powered by <b>blockchain technology</b>, which makes it decentralised. Decentralised provide individuals a sense of security and <b>more control over their assets</b> . Besides that, it is seen as a new currency in the era of
                    digitalisation, providing <b>a faster, cheaper payment solution.</b> 
                    In terms of which cryptocurrency is more popular, through our conducted survey and online research, <b>Bitcoin</b> and <b>Ethereum</b> are <b>among the most popular cryptocurrencies.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, it is not always that shiny. While cryptocurrency does have undeniable benefits, it does have some pitfalls to keep in mind. Firstly, the <b>market value of cryptocurrencies is very volatile</b> and can change from day to day or even minute to minute,
                    making it hard for people to keep the value of their assets. Secondly, thereâ€™s the <b>issue of safety</b>. You can store cryptocurrencies either self-custody or you have to rely on a third-party for it, which could increase the risk of losing it. 
                    Thus, keeping your money in a bank or any financial institution may reduce the risk of lost money, banks have strong and highly secured security measures backed by the government. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite being a safe and reliable currency, it is still <b>uncertain</b> whether cryptocurrencies will fully dominate the currency market as people are still so used to traditional currencies. 
                    Nevertheless, we can observe that some individuals are starting to tap into cryptocurrency as an alternative. With the vast amount of broker platforms available currently, getting hold of some cryptocurrency has become more accessible.
