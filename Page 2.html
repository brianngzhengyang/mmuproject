            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Cryptocurrency, or crypto, is a digital payment platform that eliminates the need to carry physical money.
                It exists only in digital form, and although people mainly use it for online transactions, you can make some physical purchases.
                Crypto is decentralised and not backed by any government or institution.
                However, for example paper money like the U.S. dollar is backed by the federal government.
                Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
                Bitcoin’s creation was inspired by the 2008 financial crisis, which highlighted the need for an alternative to the traditional banking system.The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009. 
                As of March 2022, there were more than 9,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 70 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.
                Cryptocurrency is available as coins or tokens. The difference between them is that tokens are assets that exist on a blockchain, while coins can be virtual, digital, or tangible.
